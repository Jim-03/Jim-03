        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          I am a computer science student üë®üèæ‚Äçüéì passionate about building
          full-stack applications,
          focusing mostly on backend development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I primarily work on backend systems using technologies such as{' '}
          <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and integrate them with frontend
          frameworks like{' '}
          <strong>React</strong> to deliver complete, functional solutions.
        </p>
        <p>I also work with desktop technologies such
          as <strong>JavaFX </strong> <FaJava color='orange' /> and mobile
          technologies such as <strong>Flutter </strong> <SiFlutter
            color='dodgerblue'
                                                         />.
        </p>

          <h3>Backend üñ•</h3>
          <p>
            My go-to framework in backend development is Java's{' '}
            <FaJava color='orange' /> Spring Boot because of its enterprise-level
            features.
            I find it simple to use due to its vast ecosystem, predefined
            modules,
            and built-in features such as validation, security, and database
            integration.
          </p>
          <p>Other notable frameworks I have worked with include:</p>
          <ul className={styles.skillList}>
            <li>
              <SiFastapi color='green' /> FastAPI
            </li>
            <li>
              <FaNode color='green' /> Node.js with{' '}
              <SiExpress color='yellow' /> Express
            </li>
            <li>
              <SiFlask color='red' /> Flask
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.skillSection}>
          <h3>Frontend üé®</h3>
          <p>
            <SiReact color='dodgerblue' /> React is my preferred frontend
            library,
            as it simplifies building modern web applications using reusable
            components
            compared to traditional HTML structures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <SiFlutter color='dodgerblue' /> Flutter is a close second for me,
            mainly when building mobile-first solutions with the occasional web
            deployment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vanilla JS is my least chosen stack for large-scale projects due to
            repetitive code and lack of structure.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section className={styles.skillSection}>
          <h3>Database üíæ</h3>
          <p>
            Databases are the heart of most backend applications, and I enjoy
            working with both SQL and NoSQL solutions.
          </p>
          <p>Some databases I've worked with include:</p>
          <ul className={styles.skillList}>
            <li>
              <SiMysql color='orange' /> MySQL ‚Äî my default choice for
              structured,
              relational data.
            </li>
            <li>
              <SiPostgresql color='dodgerblue' /> PostgreSQL ‚Äî for projects
              requiring advanced queries and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <SiMongodb color='green' /> MongoDB ‚Äî when working with
              document-based, flexible data models.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section className={styles.skillSection}>
          <h3>Desktop üñ•Ô∏è and Mobile üì±</h3>
          <p>Modern computing is mostly done via websites but for some reasons such as performance, internet connectivity and security, some institutions prefer desktop apps.</p>
          <p>One technology I have interacted with for desktop development is Java's <strong>JavaFX</strong> <FaJava color='orange' /> framework. It being a Java based framework comes with Java's advantage, Write Once Run anywhere.</p>
          <p><strong>Flutter</strong> <SiFlutter color='dodgerblue' /> joins this list as a dual-killer for both desktop and mobile. However, I prefer it as a mobile framework. </p>

        <h2>Soft Skills</h2>
        <p>
          Through my projects, I have developed not only technical abilities but
